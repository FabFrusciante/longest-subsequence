# longest-subsequence
A coding project for learning how to implement a search function for the longest subsequence* of a string in a textfile. Props to the app "Grasshopper" for the main ideas to the former Google interview question. *A string can be a subsequence of another string if all of its characters appear and are in the same order. For example 'hello' is a subsequence of 'help love everyone' because 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l' and 'o' appear in th second string in the same order as 'hello'.
